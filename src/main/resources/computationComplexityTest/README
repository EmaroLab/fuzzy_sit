Logs are based on "A_B_C_D" where:
    - A is the number of elements in each scene
    - B is the number of tested scenes
    - C is the number of element types in the ontology
    - D is the number of relations in the ontology
--------------------------------------------------------

The scenes evaluated has not a meaningfull semantic and they have been generated randomly.

We attempt to recognise each generated scene.
We learn each generated scene.

The scene has 
   - A elements (spanning in {e1, e2, .., eA}) each of which are of a type chosen randomly among the {t1,t2,...,tC} items.
   - two conseguitive elements has related with
            . `e1 before e2` and 
            . `e2 after e1`
     For simulations with D>2 another relation ri (spanning in {before,after,r3,r4,...,rD}) is added among two
     consecutive entities (e.g., <e1,e2>, <e2,e3>, <e3,e4>, etc.) with a probability of 50%.

(to review) OUTCOMES

 - relation weight more on computations than types
 - add a memory items implies an increase of x% on learning
 - add a memory items implies an increase of x% on recognition
 - STD deviation on average is of ...
 - adding elements to scene implies ....
 - .... other ???
 - [to review] X-axis on Learning should go from 0 to 1
